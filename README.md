   - Click on the "Pull requests" tab
   - Click "New pull request"
   - Set the base branch to "main" and compare branch to your personal branch
   - Add a title and description of your work for the week
   - Click "Create pull request"
   - Your work will be reviewed and merged

6. **Follow the Weekly Structure**
   - Read the assignment instructions for each week
   - Complete the exercises and assignments
